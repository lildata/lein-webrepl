`:user` profile in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[lein-clojars "0.8.0"]
                  [lein-webrepl "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                  [lein-difftest "1.3.7"]
                  [lein-marginalia "0.7.0"]
                  [lein-pprint "1.0.0"]]}}
```

    $ lein webrepl
```

```bash
    $ lein help webrepl
```

always start at port `8888` and web browser window 
pointing at `localhost:8888`.
